Certainly! Let's discuss the bit-level details of what we're using in this Triple DES implementation:

1. Block Size:
   DES (and Triple DES) operates on 64-bit (8-byte) blocks. This is why our `encrypt_block` and `decrypt_block` methods work on `[u8; 8]` arrays.

2. Key Size:
   - Single DES uses a 56-bit key (although it's usually represented as 64 bits with 8 parity bits).
   - Triple DES, as implemented here, uses three different 56-bit keys (again, represented as 64 bits each).
   - So our total key size is 168 bits (3 * 56), represented as 192 bits (24 bytes) including parity bits.

3. Triple DES Process:
   - Encryption: Encrypt with key1, Decrypt with key2, Encrypt with key3
   - Decryption: Decrypt with key3, Encrypt with key2, Decrypt with key1

4. Padding:
   We're using PKCS7 padding, which ensures the data is a multiple of the block size (64 bits). The padding bytes all have the same value, equal to the number of padding bytes added.

5. Data Representation:
   - We're using `u8` (8-bit unsigned integers) to represent our data at the byte level.
   - When we display the hexadecimal representation, each byte is shown as two hex digits (8 bits = 2 hex digits).

6. Hex Representation:
   - Each hexadecimal digit represents 4 bits.
   - So when you see something like "6764" in hex, it's actually:
     6 (0110) 7 (0111) 6 (0110) 4 (0100) in binary

Let's look at your example "gd":

1. ASCII/UTF-8 representation:
   'g' = 103 in decimal = 67 in hex = 01100111 in binary
   'd' = 100 in decimal = 64 in hex = 01100100 in binary

2. Original bytes (hex): 6764
   This is exactly what we expect from the ASCII values.

3. Encrypted data (hex): 0ba24aab8fe96570
   - This is 16 hexadecimal digits, which is 64 bits (8 bytes).
   - It's longer than our input because of padding. The original 2-byte input was padded to 8 bytes to fit the DES block size.

4. Decrypted bytes (hex): 6764
   This matches our original input.

In summary, we're working with:
- 8-bit bytes (u8 in Rust)
- 64-bit blocks
- 168-bit effective key size (represented as 192 bits with parity)
- Hexadecimal representation for display (where each byte is shown as two hex digits)

The Triple DES algorithm is manipulating these bits in complex ways to produce the encrypted output, but at the I/O level, we're dealing with sequences of 8-bit bytes.
